## Introduction 

The Open Block Enterprise Initiative (Open Block EI) is a collection of Web 3 Enterprise open source projects that have been incepted to migrate enterprise capabilities into Web3 and public blockchain. 
The objective of Open Block EI is to create open source, pluggable, Web 3 Enterprise components that enable new, and existing dApps to acquire Enterprise grade capabilities such as decentralized Role Management and governance. 

## Why Open Block EI?
As Web3 begins the metaverse journey towards replacing Digital Web2, the need for an Enterprise expression of Web 3 has become apparent. In short the capabilities and principles of Web 3 i.e. Open, Permissionless, Trustless and Decentralized fly in the face of Enterprise concerns of control, regulation and 'walled garden'. 
Hence simply adopting the Web 2 principles of Enterprise is insufficient. In Web 3 the migration is towards greater self soverignty, non-custodial access and individual responsibility. As such Web 3 Enterprise was born, which is the merge of the concerns of Enterprise with the freedoms of Web3, with Open Block EI as one of the many vehicles that will address this endeavour. 

## The Projects 
Open Block EI consists of several projects which are being BUIDL'd across several blockchains. 
### Open Bank 
The Open Bank project is about enabling Enterprise to acquire the capabilities of **multi-role**, **decentralized**, **non-custodial**, **banking** in Web 3 Enterprise. As the migration to Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) modes of operation gain pace in Web 3, the concept of a 'wallet' becomes inadequate to deal with the Enterprise level demands of multiple varying communities operating asynchronously across the globe. Open Bank has been created to fill this emerging void and provide Enterprise with a mechanism by which on chain banking activites can be simplified and optimised.

### Open Roles 
The Open Roles project is about enabling Enterprise to acquire the of **multi-role**, **decentralized**, on-chain access to Web 3 Enterprise services. With Web 3 concepts like Money Legos enabling dApps to be composable, the need arises for **permissionless multi-role** access to dApp provided services. 
What this translates into is the ability for organisations to provide controlled on-chain access to dApp services on public blockchain, and to readily compose on chain partner access without the challenges of firewalls networks etc.
